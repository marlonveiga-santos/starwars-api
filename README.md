# Star Wars API


API Star wars, created for the study of consumption of APIS.

This project make use of: 

- React
- React-router-dom
- Material-UI
- Styled-components

No patterns were used at the beginning but some will be inserted as needed.

I loved so much work in that way, and I don't consider being judged by the results.
